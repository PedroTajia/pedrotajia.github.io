My name is Pedro, and I’m an undergraduate Data Science student at the University of California, Riverside, where I explore artificial intelligence and machine learning through both research and real-world projects. I build and experiment with models in reinforcement learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.
Previously, I interned at [New Hampshire Ball Bearings](https://www.nhbb.com), where I worked with the manufacturing engineering team to create operation manuals for CNC machines and fine-tune machining parameters to improve efficiency, consistency, and product quality.
I am also actively involved in research communities at UCR. I participate in [R-LAIR](https://rlair.cs.ucr.edu/meetings.html), where we discuss current research papers and present our own research ideas and interests. Recently, I was accepted into the [TASL](https://tasl.ucr.edu) research lab, where I plan to focus on model-based reinforcement learning and autonomous decision-making systems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
