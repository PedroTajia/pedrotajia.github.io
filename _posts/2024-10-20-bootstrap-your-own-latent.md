## Introduction
Supervised Learning are top solution to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which are model made to solve computer vision like self-driving car, security, automatization, etc. As these computer vision tasks increases the need to improve these systems also emerges. 

One of the main ways to improve these systems is through having more data and bigger model, but unfortunately by using supervised learning these solutions need labeled data (information that have been classified by humans), which makes them expensive and difficult to get.
