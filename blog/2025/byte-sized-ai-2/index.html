Your biweekly update on everything AI! Artificial intelligence continues to grow at an extraordinary pace, embedding itself into nearly every sector of today’s world. March and April’s developments underscore the rapid evolution of the field, highlighting both the emergence of new AI agents and the challenges faced by existing ones.</p> <h3><strong>A New Trend in AI Stocks</strong></h3> <p>Amid Trump-era tariffs and ongoing stock market volatility, many are left questioning how these economic shifts might affect artificial intelligence’s evolving role in the market. As AI companies race to release new models and agents, it’s clear that AI-related stocks are under more scrutiny than ever before.</p> <p>Startups like OpenAI — recently valued at $40 billion — are making waves, signaling strong investor confidence in emerging AI technologies. However, according to <em>Investor’s Business Daily</em>, “One view is that software companies will emerge as the best AI stocks if they can monetize new products and services.” This suggests a shift in focus: rather than startups centered around building AI infrastructure, companies that use AI strategically to drive revenue may have the upper hand when it comes to securing capital. Reflecting this trend, many firms are pivoting toward AI-powered optimization, aiming to “boost productivity by developing customized AI for specific industries.”</p> <p>This dynamic raises an important question: will established software companies ultimately eclipse AI-first startups, or can the latter still lead the charge? OpenAI’s massive funding round indicates that the startup sector is far from out of the race. Yet moving forward, what matters most is not which companies talk the most about AI — but which ones effectively harness it to enhance their products.</p> <h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence: Your New Therapist?</strong></h3> <p>In the rapid development of AI, it is not uncommon for new agents to pop up, aiming to replace tasks that are done in regular daily life. Recent research suggests that “given the right kind of training, AI bots can deliver mental health therapy with as much efficacy as — or more than — human clinicians,” according to NPR.</p> <p>In <em>NEJM AI</em>, a medical journal, a study on AI therapy reported the results of the first randomized clinical trial. Amidst a shortage of mental health providers, researchers from Dartmouth College trained an AI bot to help address the gap in care. The study involved 200 participants, with half receiving treatment from AI therapy bots and the other half receiving none. “Compared to those that did not receive treatment, those who did showed significant improvement.” The study also revealed a surprising emotional connection between patients and the bot.</p> <p>Although the American Psychological Association currently prohibits the use of AI bots for mental health care, the volume of clinical research and promising results from this trial suggest that the field is heading in a promising direction. The growing body of evidence signals a shift in how we might supplement or support traditional therapy in the future.</p> <h3>Microsoft 365 Copilot’s New Agents</h3> <p>Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI assistant designed to support a wide range of tasks across Microsoft applications, from Word to Excel. Recently, Microsoft expanded its Copilot suite with the introduction of two new agents — Researcher and Analyst — each tailored to handle complex information and data analysis.</p> <p>The Researcher agent “combines OpenAI’s deep research model with Microsoft 365 Copilot’s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities,” according to Microsoft. It can build strategies based on collected data, help ideate and refine products, and even generate comprehensive reports. Meanwhile, the Analyst agent lives up to its name by transforming raw data into meaningful insights within minutes. “Analyst uses chain-of-thought reasoning to progress through problems iteratively, taking as many steps as necessary to refine its reasoning and provide a high-quality answer that mirrors human analytical thinking.”</p> <p>Together, Researcher and Analyst signal a larger trend in Microsoft’s roadmap: a strong commitment to embedding artificial intelligence wherever possible to enhance the efficiency and capabilities of their tools.</p> <h3>Behind OpenAI’s Funding</h3> <p>OpenAI has been on the rise as the forefront of the artificial intelligence landscape, and its recent funding has proven its mark on the field. Securing a staggering $40 billion in funding, this marks “the largest private tech fundraise in history.”</p> <p>The funding round was led by SoftBank, a Japanese investment giant known for backing major technology companies through its Vision Fund — a venture capital fund that targets global tech innovators like OpenAI. Other major contributors included Microsoft, Coatue, Altimeter, and Thrive Capital. In total, the $40 billion raise brings OpenAI’s valuation to an impressive $300 billion. According to CNBC, about $18 million of that funding will be allocated to a project called Stargate, which focuses on building advanced AI infrastructure.</p> <p>This historic investment not only cements OpenAI’s dominance in the AI space but also signals the growing global commitment to artificial intelligence.</p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <ol> <li><a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5351312/artificial-intelligence-mental-health-therapy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5351312/artificial-intelligence-mental-health-therapy</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/</a></li> <li><a href="https://marksmendaily.com/technology/openais-40b-fundraise-raises-agi-development-stakes/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://marksmendaily.com/technology/openais-40b-fundraise-raises-agi-development-stakes/</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/openai-closes-40-billion-in-funding-the-largest-private-fundraise-in-history-softbank-chatgpt.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/openai-closes-40-billion-in-funding-the-largest-private-fundraise-in-history-softbank-chatgpt.html</a></li> </ol> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e1fc5500ea4a" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
